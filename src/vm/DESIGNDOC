			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES

#define INIT_MAPID 0   // First id of a memory mapped file..
#define MUNMAP_ALL -2  // Has to be smaller than -1(!) because -1 is a ERROR case.

Extesions of struct thread:
	struct list mapped_files; 	// This list holds pointers of all memory mapped files 
							  	// (struct mapped_file_t). 
	int next_mapid;			  	// Represents the next free map-id

struct mapped_file_t 
{
  struct list_elem elem;
  int fd;						// File descriptor of mapped file.		
  int mapid;					// Id of the mapping (unique within a thread).
  void *addr;					// Data address.
  struct list spt_entries;		// List of supplemental page table entry which represent the mapping.
};

Each use thread has a list of memory mapped files with a unique id. 
To ensure this we use a counter with is increased if mmap is 
successfully called. Calling mmap creates a struct which represents
the memory mapped file and an number of supplemental page table
entries. At this point nothing is loaded, because this should happen
lazy (similar to loading the executable). In case of evction we don't
swap the page. If the page is dirty we write it back to the corresponding 
file. Otherwise we only free the frame and some other things required.

Calling munmap has a similar behavior. First we have to check if the
mapping is valid and get the structure which represents the mapping.
Next we iterate over the spt_entries list. This list holds all
supplemental page table entries of a mapping. If a page is dirty we
write it back to the corresponding file. At least we free all acquired
resoucres. 

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

To determine whether a new file mapping overlaps any exisiting segments
we iterate over the address range of the file and lookup each address
in the supplemental page table of the thread. If there are no entries
the file can be mapped. Otherwise it overlaps with some existing and
we don't create the mapping.

For loading the required pages we use the same mechanism for executables 
and memory mapped files. The function spt_load_page handles this case. 
One rease to do so that the procedure is nearly the same. We also use the 
same function to evict a frame for both cases.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
