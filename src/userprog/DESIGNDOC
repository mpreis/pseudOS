			   ARGUMENT PASSING

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

No new structs or variables are used for the implementation of argument 
passing.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Argument passing is basically implemented as described in Pintos 
documentation. The filename and arguments are splitted with the given 
strtok_r() function. Different to the documentation, we push the filename 
and the arguments in the given order on the stack. So, the stack for the 
following command "/bin/ls -l foo bar" looks like this:

Address		Name			Data		Type
0xbffffffc	argv[0][...]	/bin/ls\0	char[8]
0xbffffff8	argv[1][...]	-l\0		char[3]
0xbffffff5	argv[2][...]	foo\0		char[4]
0xbfffffed	argv[3][...]	bar\0		char[4]
0xbfffffec	word-align		0			uint8_t
0xbfffffe8	argv[4]			0			char *
0xbfffffe4	argv[3]			0xbfffffed	char *
0xbfffffe0	argv[2]			0xbffffff5	char *
0xbfffffdc	argv[1]			0xbffffff8	char *
0xbfffffd8	argv[0]			0xbffffffc	char *
0xbfffffd4	argv			0xbfffffd8	char **
0xbfffffd0	argc			4			int
0xbfffffcc	return address	0			void (*) ()

The order of values doesn't matter, as long as the pointers on the values 
are in the correct order. We decided to use this way, because we can simply 
iterate over the command string and store the values in the argv array.
Later, when pushing the pointers, we iterate over the array in reversed order.

//TODO: How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

For the usage of strtok_r() the context pointer is held by the caller of the 
function. This is important for our pintos system, because multiple threads 
will use it "at the same time" with different context pointers, which wouldn't 
be possible with strtok().


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

A possible advantage of the UNIX approach is for security reasons. Instead of 
passing everything (maybe malicious code) directly to the operating system, 
the input can be parsed and checked before in the shell. 

It could also lead to a better performance, because wrong or missing arguments 
or filenames can be checked wihtin the shell.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

For reading and writing user data similar thing have to be done. Due 
to the fact, that the user can pass null pointers, unmapped virtual 
memory or a pointer to kernel memory space we have to check all of 
these possibilities. This is done in the function is_valid_usr_ptr().

As you can read in B2, in our project all file descriptors of a 
specific thread are hold in an thread-local array with size 128. 
0, 1 are resevered for STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO. These two 
cases are handled seperatly for reading from the keyboard with 
input_getc() and writing to the concole with putbuf(). 

In any other case we check if the file descriptor is between 2 and 128, 
which means a valid file descriptor in our operating system. Furthermore 
we have to check if the file descriptor is not NULL. 
If all checks passed, we read and write with the given file_read() and 
file_write() functions. 

We use a lock to ensure that we avoid race conditions.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Each child process holds a semaphore init. sema_down() for this child 
is done in the thread_create() function. sema_up() is called after 
loading.

In the exec system call, the current thread tries a sema_down() on his 
childs init semaphore and has to wait until sema_up() is called after 
loading. sema_up is called in case of success or failure. 

To tell the parent process whether load is successful or not, a child 
process has another variable called load_success, which is true in case 
of success or false in case of failure.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
