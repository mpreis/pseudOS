Extensions of filesys/inode.c:
	struct inode_disk
	{
	  /* meta */
	  off_t length;                             /* File size in bytes. */
	  block_sector_t direct[NR_OF_DIRECT];      /* 12 * BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 6144 bytes. */
	  block_sector_t single_indirect;           /* 128 * BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 65536 bytes. */
	  block_sector_t double_indirect;           /* 128 * 128 * BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 8388608 bytes. */
	  bool is_dir;								/* Show if this inode represents a file or dir */
	  unsigned magic;                           /* Magic number. */
	  uint32_t unused [NR_OF_INDIRECT - NR_OF_DIRECT - 5];
	};

Like before inode_disk represents an inode which is hold on the disk 
to save the data persistent. 

	struct inode 
	{
		struct list_elem elem;                	/* Element in inode list. */
		block_sector_t sector;                	/* Sector number of disk location. */
		int open_cnt;                         	/* Number of openers. */
		bool removed;                         	/* True if deleted, false otherwise. */
		int deny_write_cnt;                   	/* 0: writes ok, >0: deny writes. */
		struct lock lock;						/* Fine-grained lock per inode */

		bool is_dir;							/* Show if this inode represents a file or dir */
		off_t length;                         	/* File size in bytes. */
		block_sector_t direct[NR_OF_DIRECT];  	/* 12 * BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 6144 bytes. */
		block_sector_t single_indirect;       	/* 128 * BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 65536 bytes. */
		block_sector_t double_indirect;       	/* 128 * 128 * BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 8388608 bytes. */
	};

struct unode is the in-memory representation of the inode. Compared 
with the previous implementation there is no reference on the 
disk_inode anymore, just the number of the disk sector where the 
disk_inode can be found.

The sector size is 512B, this leads to a maximum file size of
	max_file_size = 16524 * 512B = 8460288B

As it is proposed in the documentation we decided to implement a UNIX 
like file system. This means we have 12 direct, 1 indirect and 1 
double-indirect blocks. Unlike in UNIX we haven't implemented a triple 
indirect block, because it is just required to support 8MB files, which 
is fine with direct, indirect and double indirect.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

Extensions of thread/threads.h:
    struct dir *cwd;		/* each thread needs to hold the directory 
    							he is currently working on */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

To traverse a user-specified path, we go the logical way from the left 
the right. This means, at first we check if it is a absolute or a 
relative path by looking at the first symbol, which is a forward slash 
or not. For an absolute path we have to start at the root, otherwise we 
start at the current working directory. After that, we take each part of 
the directory name of the path and check if it exists. If so, we open it 
and go on with that folder. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

We have implemented a fine-grained locking mechanism at inode level. 
To avoid the above described situations we acquire a lock on the 
specific inode when removing or adding a directory. 

>> B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current

>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?

We have several check in our filesys_remove() implementation to avoid 
all unwanted situations. In particular we check if the directory 
which should be removed is the root or the current working directory. 
Furthermore we check if the directory is empty, just in this case it 
is allowed to remove it. 
In any case of failure we return false and tell the caller that 
removing the directory failed. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.

Every process needs to know his actual working directory at any time, 
so the only useful way for us was to add a thread-local directory 
variable.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you

the quarter.
